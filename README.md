# Elliptical 4 Legged Robot
### Description
We used 2 servo motor, called MG996R, for each leg so the robot has total of 8 servo motors. For controlling the robot, HC-05 was used to establish serial Bluetooth communication. 3S1P Lithium Ion batteries were used to power motor and another set of 3S1P were used to power up the Arduino and HC-05. Body and all the mechanical parts were 3D printed with PLA+, except servo motor gears.<br><br>
